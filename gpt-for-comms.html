          Due to time constraints and limited resources, developing a fully functional chatbot prototype wasn’t feasible. This meant that some usability features couldn’t be fully demonstrated.

          However, I chose to conduct an Expert Evaluation to gather valuable insights for future design iterations and gain hands-on experience applying Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
