                                        Our audience had no prior reference point for buying new cars from us, and without access to authorized dealer (AD) assets, 
                                        we needed new ways to explain the process, manage expectations,

                                        The challenge was to innovate within tight constraints,

                                    Using insights from the research, I began creating wireframes and experimenting with different visual styles. 
                                    A key challenge was the lack of high-quality dealer assets, so I focused on developing a sleek, 
                                    minimal design that could still build trust and convey professionalism.
                                    
                                </p> <p>I refined the visual language with modern typography, improved spacing, and a carefully selected color palette. To ensure consistency across the platform, I built a component library that kept everything aligned as the design evolved. Regular feedback sessions with fellow designers and the Project Manager allowed me to iterate and refine the concept continuously.

                                    After several rounds of design exploration, we landed on a minimal, sleek style that communicated affordable luxury. Given the tight project timeline, 
                                    I conducted 10 internal user interviews via Lark calls. While the research was more condensed 
                                    than usual, it gave me valuable insights into user pain points and preferences, 
                                    which helped guide further iterations.</p>
                                    <p>I also created designs for both web and mobile, considering responsiveness 
                                        across multiple breakpoints (375, 576, 768, 992). 
                                        The goal was to ensure the experience felt intuitive and seamless 
                                        on any device.</p>

                                    This phase included gathering feedback, 
                                    making revisions, and refining the experience through 
                                    several rounds of iteration. Each round improved the design’s 
                                    functionality and user flow, ensuring we were aligning with both business goals and user needs.</p>
