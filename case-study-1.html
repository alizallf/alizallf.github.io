    <!--Part 1: Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Business team needed fresh screens for a campaign launching in Singapore, focused on selling new cars—shifting from the company’s usual focus on used cars.</p>
            <p>At the onset of the project, we conducted a thorough brainstorming session to define the key USPs. Drawing on my marketing background, I collaborated closely with the Product Manager to pinpoint the unique aspects of this initiative’s offerings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Defining the USP</h2>
            <p>Together, we identified the main USP for this initiative: <strong>Test to Own Programme</strong>. Carro’s unique "Test to Own" programme allows customers to test-drive a vehicle for a set number of days for a fee—an option not typically provided by authorized dealers.</p>
            <p>With the USP set in place and the "why" figured out, it was time to get to the design work!</p>
        </section>



    <!--Part 2: Design Iteration -->
        
         <section>
             <h2>Design Iteration</h2>
                <p>To kick off the design process, I first conducted competitive research...</p>
            
                <!-- Wrap the image inside a flexbox div with animation-->
                <div class="image-wrapper">

                  </div>

                  <br>

                <p>Below are some early homepage drafts. Good design work can't be done in a silo, 
                    so I regularly gathered feedback from fellow designers and the Project Manager, 
                    refining the concepts through collaboration and iteration.</p>
        
        </section>



    <!--Part 3: Feedback and iteration -->
        <section> 
            <h2>Feedback and Iteration</h2>
            <p>After several rounds of exploration, we landed on a minimal, sleek style that evoked a sense of affordable luxury.</p>
            <p>Given the tight project timeline, I conducted a series of phone interviews with 10 internal users to gather actionable insights. While the research was more limited than usual, it helped us quickly identify key pain points and preferences. These insights were invaluable in refining the design to align with both user needs and business goals, and I continued iterating the screens from there.</p>

    <!--Part 4: Final Touches and Handoff -->
        <section> 
            <h2>Final Touches and Preparing for Dev hand-off</h2>
            <p>After multiple iterations and several in-depth cross-departmental calls to refine every detail, I finalized the wireframes and interactive prototype which I presented to the team and all the stakeholders involved. 
                ​
                And finally it was good to go! 
                To ensure a seamless developer handoff, 
                I documented all key notes and design specifications clearly. 
                I also joined calls with the developers to walk them through the project 
                and address any questions they may have. </p>
        
                <br>

         <!--Part 5: Challenges -->

        <section> 
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>While the project was exciting and helped me grow as a designer, it also came with a few challenges. </p>
        
            <br> 

            <h3>Challenge 1: Educating Customers on a New Initiative</h3>
            <p>As this was the company’s first venture into selling new cars - something outside our usual branding - it was crucial to clearly communicate the initiative to customers. Without access to authorized dealer (AD) assets, we had to find alternative ways to build trust and set clear expectations.

                To address this, I designed informative cards that guided users through the process step by step. Each card 
                broke down the necessary actions (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3), 
                making it easy for customers to understand what to expect from the campaign</p>

               <br>

  <br>            
  
  <h3>Challenge 2: Balancing the Design System with a Fresh, Chic Look</h3>

  <br> 
            <p>Another challenge was the need to create something that felt new, modern, and chic, while still adhering to the design system. We needed to innovate within the established guidelines without straying too far from the brand’s identity - while also working without any assets from authorized dealers (ADs). 

                To overcome this, I utilised typography, colors, and layout creatively within the design system 
                to introduce a sleek, refined look. Without AD assets, the focus shifted to strong visual 
                storytelling and thoughtful design choices to establish trust and credibility with our 
                customers. Through this approach, we were able to ensure design consistency while giving 
                this campaign a fresh, premium feel. </p>

                <br> 

            <!-- Challenge 2 image -->

                </a>
              </div>

              <br> 

            <h3>Challenge 3: Collaborating with a Cross-Functional Team</h3>
            <p>Working with a cross-functional team was an invaluable experience. It gave me the opportunity to see the project from multiple perspectives and navigate the challenge of balancing input from various stakeholders. Each team had different priorities and roles, so aligning everyone toward a shared vision required clear and effective communication.
                ​
                Though challenging at times, the collaboration was ultimately successful. I ensured transparency by proactively initiating calls and keeping everyone regularly updated. I also managed expectations early on and advocated for proper design guidelines wherever applicable.
                ​
                Overall, I received positive feedback on my work ethic and accountability, as I took responsibility for ensuring the project was executed in the best way possible—meeting both business and user needs. </p>

 <!--Part 6: Summary -->
        <section> 
            <h3>Summary and Closing Remarks </h3>
            <p>This was an exciting first project at the company, where I learned to be creative and innovative despite constraints. From working without authorized dealer assets to managing stakeholder expectations, the experience pushed me to think strategically and adapt quickly.
                ​
                Beyond refining my design skills, this project taught me how to balance business and user needs, collaborate effectively with a large team, and approach problem-solving with creativity. I’m proud that we successfully launched this initiative with users at the forefront, and hopefully, it helps someone take the first step toward testing, and eventually owning, their dream car.
